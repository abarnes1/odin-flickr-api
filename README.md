# Flickr API Project
This [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api) part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodingproject.com/)'s [Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails) curriculum.  It is intended to introduce the basics of consuming an API.

## Usage
You may search a Flickr user id and see 10 public photos for that user.  If you don't know any user ids, the initial placeholder value in the search form belongs to someone who likes to take pictures of dogs and squirrels.

## Notes
Handling exceptions from the api was a good idea. Any issues from the Flickr api (service outage, processing a bad request) won't lead to an error page being displayed.
